#from looking at the data from the histogram the bar that stands out the most is that more than 800 people have been unemployed for less than (give or take) 10 weeks. Then from there it goes way down. The next spike in the bar occurs when around 100 people have been unemployed from around 50 to 60 weeks. The crazy part to me about this histagram is the amount of people from just this small frame of data we have who have been unemployed for over 100 weeks. But beoynd that this histogram has the distribution I expected from looking at the data.

# comparing the means of those in the labor force who either have a high school degree, bachelors degree, or professional degree, the results are pretty similar. As expected the lower the degree you have the higher the unemployment level. I thought the high school mean would be a bit higher but nowadays it is easier for people to get jobs that dont require higher education. Then when it comes to to Bachelor and Professional the numbers make sense especially because of Covid, a lot of people are out of work and still searching. But overall I would say these means fit the data.
