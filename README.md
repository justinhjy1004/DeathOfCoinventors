## Dead Inventors
For the instrument of dead inventors to be exogenous, we want it to be *random* and *surprising*. We also want it to be *certain*.

Hence, we are going to only get dead inventors that are
1. Highly validated
2. Age, for the unexpected nature
3. If they are still participating in knowledge creation
4. Matches with PatentsView
